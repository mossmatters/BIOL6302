## Methods of Assessing Expected Learning Outcomes

Student learning outcomes will be assessed via: 

- Participation in discussion during Tuesday lectures and Thursday practical exercises.
- A short written paper early in the semester, in which students demonstrate understanding of tree thinking concepts.
- A written project proposal designed by the student that implements methods learned in class. 
- A ten-minute in-class presentation showing the results of the proposed project.
- A 8-10 page project paper.  

### Evaluation

**Particpation.** Each week, on Tuesdays there will be lecture material related to required reading indicated in the schedule above. Students are expected to have done the reading before class and to ask questions during lecture. Some weeks there may also be additional group discussion, and participation is encouraged. On Thursdays, students will be given an in-class assignment "practical" to reinforce the topic that week. These assignments will not be graded, but participation is required.

**Short Paper.** During the first few weeks of class, students will be given an in-class assignment to score "traits" on the Caminalcules, a set of imagined cartoon organisms. Students will be expected to reconstruct a phylogeny from these traits and evaluate support for relationships as if they are preparing a taxonomic monograph of the Caminalcules. The results of this analysis should be written up into a 3-5 page paper describing the methods used to score traits, infer the phylogeny, and taxonomic conclusions. The short paper will be evaluated for correct use of tree thinking. **The short paper will be due October 1.**

**Project Proposal.** The main assessment for the course is a small independent project designed and carried out by the student. This project may cover any topic relevant to phylogenetics that is of interest to the student. The project can take many forms, including phylogenetic systematics, comparison of phylogenetic methods, re-analysis of published data, or any type of applied phylogenetics such as community ecology or phylogenomics. Use of data relevant to the student's research project is highly encouraged, but not required. The student may obtain data from the instructor if desired. To ensure the project is appropriate for the class and time frame, a brief proposal for the project (fewer than 500 words) is due **October 29**.

**Project Presentation.** On the last day of class **(December 3)**, students will describe the results of their project in a short (8-10 minute) presentation to the class. All in attendance, including students and the instructor, will provide peer-evaluations of the presentations. Students will be assessed on clarity of presentation, use of appropriate tree-thinking terminology and phylogenetic methods. The length of the presentation may be altered depending on the size of the course.

**Project Paper.** Students will prepare a 8-10 page (double-spaced) report describing their project. The report should take the form of a peer-reviewed scientific paper, with an introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion, and references. Project papers must include at least two figures and/or tables, which will not be considered part of the overall paper length. Students may choose any format for citations and references (i.e. footnotes or in-line citations) but must remain internally consistent. Project papers will be evaluated for providing appropriate context for the project in the phylogenetic literature, correct application of tree thinking, the phylogenetic methods, and the logic of the conclusions drawn. Students will not be evaluated on whether their project "worked," as experimentation is encouraged. A full grading rubric will be supplied to students later in the semester. The final paper is due one week after the presentations, on **December 10**.

## COVID Contingency Statement
### Illness-Based Absence Policy
If at any time during this semester you feel ill, in the interest of your own health and safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events.  Please review the steps outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused.  These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes because of illness.If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related:

1. Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.

2. Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage. This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in classes for more than one week.

3. If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the period of time you may be absent from and may return to classes.

4. If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps below:
 
	a. If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes, you are encouraged to visit with either Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  Note that Student Health Services and your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits.
	
	b. During the health provider visit, request a “return to school” note
	
	c. E-mail the instructor a picture of that note;
	
	d. Return to class by the next class period after the date indicated on your note.
 
Following the steps outlined above helps to keep your instructors informed about your absences and ensures your absence or missing an assignment due date because of illness will be marked excused.  You will still be responsible to complete within a week of returning to class any assignments, quizzes, or exams you miss because of illness.


## Course Policies and Resources

### Civility in the Classroom

You are expected to conduct yourselves in such a way as to provide a good learning environment for yourself and other students. Therefore, disruptions or behaviors that affect your ability to learn and that of other students will not be tolerated. If you are being disruptive, you will be asked to leave.

During online discussions, please be respectful of each other's time and the time of the instructor. Language that is hostile or discriminatory will not be tolerated. Be mindful of microagressions; be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others and contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Work towards an inclusive environment in the classroom.

### Academic Honesty

It is the aim of the faculty of Texas Tech University to foster a spirit of complete honesty and high standard of integrity. 
The attempt of students to present as their own any work not honestly performed is regarded by the faculty and administration as a most serious offense and renders the offenders liable to serious consequences, possibly suspension.
"Scholastic Dishonesty" includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records, misrepresenting facts, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student 
(such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor) or the attempt to commit such an act.

**Plagiarism on projects and presentations will not be tolerated.**
I will be using resources including turnitin.net to evaluate student papers for evidence of plagiarism. In academic communication, plagiarism is not limited to simply copying another's work, but may also include improper citation of facts, results, and quotations. If you are unsure, please ask me prior to turning in the assignment. Once an assignment is turned in, I will not tolerate any form of plagiarism. Any form of plagiarism will be met with a "0" for that assignment, and violations will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct to determine appropriate disciplinary action.

### WITHDRAWAL/DROPPING THE CLASS ([TTU OP 34.05](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.05.pdf))
Students may officially drop a course through the 45th class day of a long semester or the 15th class day of a summer term and receive the grade of W regardless of their progress in the class.  
Students must determine the deadline for dropping this semester.  
After the deadline, the student must complete the course for a grade. 

### INCOMPLETE ([TTU OP 34.12](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/op34.12.pdf), 34.05)

Grades of I may be applicable when circumstances beyond the student's control, such as illness or impairment due to an accident, prevent the student from completing course requirements. 
The instructor assigning the grade will stipulate in writing at the time the grade is given the conditions under which the I may be removed. 
The assigned work and a change of grade must be recorded within one calendar year from the date of the I. 
Failure to do so results in an F for that course. 

### ADA STATEMENT ([OP 34.22](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/opmanual/OP34.22.pdf)):

Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make any necessary arrangements.
Students should present appropriate verification from Student Disability Services during the instructor's office hours. 
Please note: instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification from Student Disability Services has been provided. 
For additional information, please contact Student Disability Services in West Hall or call 806.742.2405.

### RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS

"Religious holy day" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code. 
A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. 
A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. 
A student who is excused under section 2 may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.
